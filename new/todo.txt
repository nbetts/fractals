A list of upcoming features I'd like to accomplish.


# System properties
- refactor fractal class into specific fractal types
- add more types of fractals
- build a system for switching between types of fractals
- GUI-like parameter customisation
- GUI text for presenting fractal information/debugging


# Environment properties
- shadows
- point/directional lighting toggle
- light mapping once ground textures are implemented


# Fractal properties
- add Perlin noise (or Mersenne twister) for pseudo-random fractal generation
- adjustable yRange and yDeviance in real time
- custom colour height maps for realistic looking terrain
- ground textures
