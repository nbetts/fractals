Below is a list of upcoming features I'd like to accomplish.

## System properties

* refactor fractal class into specific fractal types
* add more types of fractals (see [fractals.md](fractals.md))
* build a system for switching between types of fractals
* GUI-like parameter customisation
* GUI text for presenting fractal information/debugging

## Environment properties

* shadows
* light mapping once ground textures are implemented
* move light ambient/diffuse/specular attributes to profile.txt

## Fractal properties

* add  Mersenne twister for pseudo-random fractal generation
* adjustable yRange and yDeviance in real time without fractal regeneration
* custom colour height maps for realistic looking terrain
* ground textures
* move material ambient/diffuse/specular attributes to profile.txt
* instancing to increase the percieved size of the fractal
* move vertex normals to a geometry shader
